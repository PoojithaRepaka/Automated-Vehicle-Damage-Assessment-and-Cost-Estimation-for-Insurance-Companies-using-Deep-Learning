# Automated-Vehicle-Damage-Assessment-and-Cost-Estimation-for-Insurance-Companies-using-Deep-Learning

This project aims to revolutionize the vehicle insurance industry with an automated damage assessment solution. Leveraging YOLOv5, an advanced object detection model, this system enhances the accuracy and efficiency of evaluating damage across two-wheelers, four-wheelers, and six-wheelers.By training YOLOv5 on a diverse dataset of vehicle damage scenarios, the system accurately identifies and classifies various damage types, from minor scratches to major impacts. This automation speeds up claims processing, reduces human error, and provides precise cost estimations for repairs.Overall, this project improves operational efficiency and customer satisfaction by offering faster, more reliable service and accurate assessments.
